**Rationale**
Software and technology underpin modern science. There is an increasing demand for more sophisticated open source software, matched by an increasing willingness for researchers to openly collaborate on new tools. These
developments come with a specific ethical, legal and economic challenges that impact upon research workflows. This module will introduce the necessary tools required for transforming software into something that can be openly accessed and re-used by others.

**Learning outcomes**
* The researcher will be able to define the characteristics of open source research software, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.
* Based on community standards, researchers will be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.
* The researcher will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open source software.
* Individual researchers will be able to transform code designed for their personal
use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.
