## Partnership

### Core partners

Science together. If you believe that your work is aligned with that of the 
MOOC, come and join us in making Open Science a reality!

### Institutional partners

Institutional organizations that help to locally deliver the MOOC modules.

## Sponsors

The Open Science MOOC is a volunteer-driven project. We rely on the goodwill 
and time of a huge number of people working together to work. We have received 
a grant from [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/) to help with the technical 
aspects of the MOOC (e.g., purchasing equipment), and a 
[Shuttleworth Foundation](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/) flash grant to 
our founder to help boost the project. We keep costs at an absolute minimum, 
but if you believe in what we do and want to help out, we appreciate any 
financial assistance
