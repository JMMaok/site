<!-- START OF FREE MARKDOWN  -->
I work at Utrecht University Library and on the project One-Hundred and One Innovations in Scholarly Communication, charting open science principles, practices and platforms. I also do lots of workshops and training. I like talking with researchers, publishers, funders, anyone about motivations and barriers to open science, and how to make that happen - the sooner the better, the more the better.
