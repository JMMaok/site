<!-- START OF FREE MARKDOWN  -->
I have a PhD in computational nanomechanics focusing on soft tissue mechanics, Right now I work as a Research Software Engineer, and as such I work with other RSEs and researchers to help them develop better software for research and also for them to make better use of their data. I am a passionate advocate for open research and open source software and ,of course, the awesome communities aroun these. I am particularly interested in reproducibility, replicability, and provenance in research and on data integrity and validation.
