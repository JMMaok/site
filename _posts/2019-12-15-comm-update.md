Dear Open Science MOOCers and interested individuals,

The past month has been quite intense for us all, when the Steering Committee has put their heads together to keep the MOOC afloat and reorganize its governance. Module developments and translation work will soon continue and we welcome all your suggestions, input and ideas to any of the developing stages along the way.


## Code of Conduct
(Bianka and Chris H to write a short notification)


## Tasks distribution

Jon Tennant was performing most of the communication work. We redistributed responsibilities for the different channels as follows:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/opensciencemooc): Lisa Hehnke for important announcements
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/opensciencemooc): Ivo Grigorov, Jo Havemann
- [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu): Lisa Hehnke, Jo Havemann, Tobias Steiner
- [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC) (pull request reviews, admin work): Tobias Steiner, Danny Colin
- [Eliademy](https://eliademy.com/opensciencemooc): Ivo Grigorov, Tobias Steiner (infrastructure); Jo Havemann, Lisa Hehnke (content)
- [Slack](https://openmooc-ers.slack.com): Julien Colomb


## Finding a new Learning platform

Our current MOOC platform Eliademy has [recently declared bankruptcy](https://blog.eliademy.com/2019/11/15/sad-news/), so we are now currently on the lookout for alternative platforms and would very much welcome your input and collaboration on this important matter. 

Do you have good experience and would like to suggest possible solutions for the OpenScienceMOOC? Don't hesitate to get in touch via [the #platform channel in our open Slack group](https://openmooc-ers.slack.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenScienceMOOC/), or drop us an email at [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu).


**We whish you all a happy end of 2019 and a good start into 2020!**

Your [OpenScienceMOOC steering committee](https://opensciencemooc.eu/people/), Bianca Kramer and Chris Hartgerink
