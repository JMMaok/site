Dear Open Science MOOCers and interested individuals,

The past month has been quite intense for us all, when the Steering Committee has put their heads together to keep the MOOC afloat and reorganize its governance. Module developments and translation work will soon continue and we welcome all your suggestions, input and ideas to any of the developing stages along the way.


## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct committee can be reached at <conduct@opensciencemooc.eu>. Per the [recent announcement](https://opensciencemooc.eu/statement/2019/11/15/official-sc-statement/), a few changes occurred, resulting in a new composition of the committee: Bianca Kramer, Ricardo Hartley, and Chris Hartgerink. We are working on a clearer reporting protocol, to provide clarity in how reports are dealt with in a responsible manner. 

We are also preparing a call for nominations for an external member of the committee, which we expect to launch in January 2020. With this, we hope to increase our accountability and improve our knowledge and expertise in defining, implementing and enforcing our code of conduct. We also want to ensure the necessary representativeness and inclusiveness. 


## Tasks distribution

Jon Tennant was performing most of the communication work. We redistributed responsibilities for the different channels as follows:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/opensciencemooc): Lisa Hehnke for important announcements
- [Facebook](https://facebook.com/opensciencemooc): Ivo Grigorov, Jo Havemann
- [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu): Lisa Hehnke, Jo Havemann, Tobias Steiner
- [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC) (pull request reviews, admin work): Tobias Steiner, Danny Colin
- [Eliademy](https://eliademy.com/opensciencemooc): Ivo Grigorov, Tobias Steiner (infrastructure); Jo Havemann, Lisa Hehnke (content)
- [Slack](https://openmooc-ers.slack.com): Julien Colomb


## Finding a new Learning platform

Our current MOOC platform Eliademy has [recently declared bankruptcy](https://blog.eliademy.com/2019/11/15/sad-news/), so we are now currently on the lookout for alternative platforms and would very much welcome your input and collaboration on this important matter. 

Do you have good experience and would like to suggest possible solutions for the Open Science MOOC? Don't hesitate to get in touch via [the #platform channel in our open Slack group](https://openmooc-ers.slack.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenScienceMOOC/), or drop us an email at [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu).


**We wish you all a happy end of 2019 and a good start into 2020!**

Your [Open Science MOOC steering committee](https://opensciencemooc.eu/people/)
