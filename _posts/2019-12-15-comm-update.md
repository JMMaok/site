Dear open science moocers, dear interested people,

The last month has been quite intense for all of us, and the steering committee has been working hard to keep the MOOC afloat and start its reorganisation.
This has delayed module development and translation work, but be sure it has not stopped it (come back next month for new announcement you will love).

In brief, we have focused our work on developing a better code of conduct implementation,
and hope anyone will feel safe in participating in our community.
We have also started to restructure the leadership of this project,
redistributing the numerous tasks Jon Tennant was performing to the SC members.
In addition, we are starting to refund the organisation and its governance in its core and we will instaure SC members election in 2020.
On top of that, one major tool/platform we were using (Eliademy) has announce the end of its activity (REF)
and we are looking for a good alternative.

## Code of Conduct

## Tasks distribution

Dr. Tenant was performing most of the communication work of the OS-MOOC. We took back control of the different channels and assigned new responsabilities. The activity in these channels will probably be reduced, but we will continue to welcome each new member and question the best we can. For each channel, we assign 1-2 people to be the major actors there, but the whole SC shares accountability:

## OS MOOC governance

## Our future MOOC platform

## 2020 teasers

- What would you think about a re:search satellite event to re:publica 2020 ?

- We are still discussing a transfer from slack to mattermost, and from Github to gitlab. It will come, soon.

We whish you all an happy end of the year!

The OS MOOC steering committee
