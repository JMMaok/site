Dear Open Science MOOCers and all interested,

After the rush of last year, we needed some time to rest and we are entering a new activity round: we are convinced that 2020 will be awesome for open science! There are still working progresses we want to share with you

## Code of Conduct



## Governance and tasks distribution

We have not made much progress here, but we are still planning to refresh the steering committee in a near future, please keep in touch on the slack #steering channel.

## Identifying a new learning platform

Our past MOOC platform Eliademy is not available anymore [announced cease of operations](https://blog.eliademy.com/2019/11/15/sad-news/), and we have been looking into the options offered to us. After evaluation of the different tools ( [see this wiki page on github](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Main/wiki/Next-MOOC-platform), moodle seemed to be a straighforward option and we are now looking into moodle hosting possibilities. Thanks @lambo for suggesting https://www.oncampus.de, we do love the [h5p](https://h5p.org/) functionality and we are now [running some tests](https://www.oncampus.de/course/OS-principles). We are also looking at having our own moodle instance Tobias prepared for us.

The decision is not taken yet, so if you have experience in running a learning platform and would like to suggest possible solutions for the Open Science MOOC, don't hesitate to get in touch via [the #platform channel in our open Slack group](https://openmooc-ers.slack.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenScienceMOOC/), or drop us an email at [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu).

**Reach out to share your questions, critics or encouragements !**

Your [Open Science MOOC steering and CoC committees](https://opensciencemooc.eu/people/).
