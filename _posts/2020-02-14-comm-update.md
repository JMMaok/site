Dear Open Science MOOCers and all interested,

After the rush of last year, we needed some time to rest and we are entering a new activity round: we are convinced that 2020 will be awesome for open science and the open science MOOC! We expect a lot of changes in the next months with a renew of our Steering Committee.



## Governance and tasks distribution

We have been discussing a new organisation to drive the OSMOOC community effort. In accordance to this new organisation, our key priority is to renew our Steering Committee (SC).
We came to the conclusion to collectively step down from the SC on April first, in order to allow for a fair election of a novel SC, providing space for a new group of committed individuals to continue [our vision and mission](https://opensciencemooc.eu/about/). The OS MOOC as brought exciting collaborations to life and will certainly continue to do so. Being part of the SC was an honor and a great adventure, that may not stop.

As member of the OSMOOC community, you are therefore asked to propose a human being who you think will be able to steer this project in the right direction, we will then contact them to see if they are interested: please send us an email: [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu) stating who you would like to see take a SC chair, giving contact information. You can of course name yourself as well as members of the present SC.

A very important message we took home from session 11 of the barcamp (see below) is that non-experts are better at teaching and reaching out to newbies, and we would encourage anyone with very little experience in open science to feel empowered: the MOOC needs your expertise and we would love to see you taking the wheel of this project.

We will then come with a voting system later in April.


## Identifying a new learning platform

Our past MOOC platform Eliademy is not available anymore [announced cease of operations](https://blog.eliademy.com/2019/11/15/sad-news/), and we have been looking into the options offered to us. After evaluation of the different tools ([see this wiki page on github](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Main/wiki/Next-MOOC-platform), moodle seemed to be a straighforward option and we are now looking into moodle hosting possibilities. Thanks @lambo for suggesting https://www.oncampus.de, we do love the [h5p](https://h5p.org/) functionality and we are now [running some tests](https://www.oncampus.de/course/OS-principles). We are also looking at having our own moodle instance Tobias prepared for us.

The decision is not taken yet, so if you have experience in running a learning platform and would like to suggest possible solutions for the Open Science MOOC, don't hesitate to get in touch via [the #platform channel in our open Slack group](https://openmooc-ers.slack.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenScienceMOOC/), or drop us an email at [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu).

## open science barcamp

Many of us participated in one of the most exciting Open Science events of the year. We proposed several sessions for the Open Science Barcamp, the innovative day 0 of the more formal Berlin Open Science Conference. You can find more details at https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/oscibar2020 (especially sessions 2,3,5,7,11, and 12) . Come and explore what is there for you in the MOOC or how you can integrate your own perspectives on Open Science!


You can follow the event on twitter via the #oscibar hashtag and listen to last year's highlights on the Open Science Radio : http://www.openscienceradio.org/.
