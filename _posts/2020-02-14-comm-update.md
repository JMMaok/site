Dear Open Science MOOCers and all interested,

After the rush of last year, we needed some time to rest and we are entering a new activity round: we are convinced that 2020 will be awesome for open science and the open science MOOC! We expect a lot of changes in the next months with a renew of our Steering Committee.



## Governance and tasks distribution

Our key priority is to renew our Steering Committee. If you are interested to join us, please contact us on the Slack #steering channel.

## Identifying a new learning platform

Our past MOOC platform Eliademy is not available anymore [announced cease of operations](https://blog.eliademy.com/2019/11/15/sad-news/), and we have been looking into the options offered to us. After evaluation of the different tools ([see this wiki page on github](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Main/wiki/Next-MOOC-platform), moodle seemed to be a straighforward option and we are now looking into moodle hosting possibilities. Thanks @lambo for suggesting https://www.oncampus.de, we do love the [h5p](https://h5p.org/) functionality and we are now [running some tests](https://www.oncampus.de/course/OS-principles). We are also looking at having our own moodle instance Tobias prepared for us.

The decision is not taken yet, so if you have experience in running a learning platform and would like to suggest possible solutions for the Open Science MOOC, don't hesitate to get in touch via [the #platform channel in our open Slack group](https://openmooc-ers.slack.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenScienceMOOC/), or drop us an email at [info@opensciencemooc.eu](mailto:info@opensciencemooc.eu).

## open science barcamp

Many of us participated in one of the most exciting Open Science events of the year. We proposed several sessions for the Open Science Barcamp, the innovative day 0 of the more formal Berlin Open Science Conference. You can find more details here: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/oscibar2020. Come and explore what is there for you in the MOOC or how you can integrate your own perspectives on Open Science!

You can follow the event on twitter via the #oscibar hashtag and listen to last year's highlights on the Open Science Radio : http://www.openscienceradio.org/.
