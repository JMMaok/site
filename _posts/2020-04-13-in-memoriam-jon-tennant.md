![In memoriam of Jon Tennant.](/assets/img/posts/in-memoriam-jon-tennant.jpg)

We are deeply saddened by the sudden death of our colleague Dr Jonathan (Jon) Tennant.

Jon was a visionary, deeply committed to making science accessible to everyone. For years, he worked tirelessly to make the world understand the urgency of the issues, writing prolifically and sharing his vision with countless people. 

In his vision of science accessible to all, Jon founded the Open Science MOOC, a platform dedicated to educating everyone interested in the different aspects of Open Science and its implications for knowledge creation and dissemination.

Thanks to Jon, the Open Science MOOC and the community he built around it are today a strong pillar in the movement towards fair, transparent, and collaborative research. We are grateful to have worked with him over the past years.

Jon will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones.

A crowdfunding campaign to help Jon’s family bringing him back home to Leicester, UK, has been initiated here: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/repatriation-burial-costs-fund-for-jon-tennant](https://www.gofundme.com/f/repatriation-burial-costs-fund-for-jon-tennant).
